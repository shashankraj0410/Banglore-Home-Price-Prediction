# Banglore-Home-Price-Prediction
Welcome to the Bengaluru House Price Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for building a machine learning model to predict house prices in Bengaluru, along with a web application to make predictions.

This project aims to predict house prices in Bengaluru using various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms and number of  bathrooms. The prediction model is built using Python and several machine learning algorithms. Additionally, a web application is developed to allow users to input house features and get the predicted price.
